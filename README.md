# MapAbility â™¿
MapAbility is a web application that allows users to rate the accessibility of streets and public attractions in different locations. Users can rate these locations as "fully accessible," "semi accessible," or "inaccessible."

The application is designed to help individuals with disabilities, organizations, and government agencies make informed decisions regarding accessibility in different locations. It also aims to promote the creation of more inclusive spaces and increase awareness of accessibility issues.

## How to Use MapAbility
To use MapAbility, simply enter a location into the search bar. The application will display a map of the area, along with a list of nearby streets and public attractions. Users can then click on each location to rate its accessibility.

To rate a location, simply click on the "Rate" button next to the location. The rating system includes three options:

- Fully Accessible: The location is fully accessible to individuals with disabilities.
- Semi Accessible: The location is partially accessible to individuals with disabilities.
- Inaccessible: The location is not accessible to individuals with disabilities.

Users can also leave comments or additional information about the location if they choose.

Once a rating is submitted, it will be added to the database and displayed on the map for other users to see.
